# Pizza Sales Data Analysis Project
This end-to-end data analysis project demonstrates my ability to transform raw business data into actionable insights using structured querying, data cleaning, and visualization techniques.
I began by working with a pizza sales dataset in MySQL, where I wrote SQL queries to extract, filter, and analyze key business metrics such as revenue trends, order frequency, and product performance. This stage focused on data exploration, aggregation, and analytical problem-solving.
Next, I exported the dataset to Excel for data preparation and refinement. I cleaned and standardized the data, created calculated columns, and built pivot tables to summarize large datasets efficiently. Using these summaries, I designed charts and combined them into a professional dashboard that visually communicates sales trends and performance insights.
